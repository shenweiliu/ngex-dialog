The `ngex-dialog` is published on the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngex-dialog). The library is designed for applications with the Angular version 9 or above.

## Installation

Run `npm install ngex-dialog` to add the library into your project directory, or add `"ngex-dialog": "^11.0.5"` to the package.json file and then run `npm install` to update the existing package.

## Details and Use Cases

To see how to use the dialog in details, please go check out the article [An Angular Modal Dialog with Advanced Functionality and Easy-use Features](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1179258/An-Angular-Modal-Dialog-with-Advanced-Functionalit).

The sample application with the article directly uses the TypeScript code of the `ngex-dialog` modules and components, not the library as downloaded here, but the use cases and workflow are the same.
