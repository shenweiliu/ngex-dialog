## Details and Use Cases

## Demo Application

The source code can be downloaded from the [github repository](https://github.com/shenweiliu/ngex-dialog).
 

## Notes on Styles

The *ex-dialog.css* file containing all base style settings for the dialog is not included in the installed library. You may need to have it under the *angular-sources_only/src/assets/css* folder from the [github repository](https://github.com/shenweiliu/ngex-dialog). The icon images for the basic-type dialogs can also be downloaded there.
